# wifi-adb-fast-connect
Wireless debugging requires usb to connect - ironic. So this small script i made instead of entering 3 commands each time and checking the port on the phone.
## Usage
- Connect phone via usb to pc
- Give executable rights (maybe first time): ```chmod +x script.sh```
- Run the script: ```./script.sh```
- Disconnect usb
- Happy debugging!
